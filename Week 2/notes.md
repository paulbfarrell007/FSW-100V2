Syntax Conventions:
We suggest always use lowercase attribute names
    
    - The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

    - The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

    - However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.
