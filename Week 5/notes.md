# Responsive Web Design
    - Designing a webpage so that a user may access your site on any sized device, mainly mobile, tablet and desktop, and your website will respond appropriately.
    
    - Common method for approach is Mobile First, meaning to do your mobile design first and then use media queries to style the tablet and desktop views.

## Media queries
Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).

Media queries are used for the following:

    - To conditionally apply styles with the CSS @media and @import at-rules.
    
    - To target specific media for the <style>, <link>, <source>, and other HTML elements with the media= attribute.
    
    - To test and monitor media states using the Window.matchMedia() and MediaQueryList.addListener() JavaScript methods.
